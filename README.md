firescopeweb
============

A simple GUI application for adding CI's into firescope monitoring solution. The GUI is built using PyQt framework and requires a few module to be imported in the python. Very experimental and could be broken as i update the GUI and functions. The web services in Firescope are limited but this application provides the features below:

- Add CI's
- Link CI's to Templates
- Delete CI's
- Create logical groups
- Create service groups

Features currently being added include:

- Hover boxes over buttons
- LineEdit check to make sure there is text in the nessecary boxes

The features are being added in are just error checkers. The aplication needs to be more robust, it works well just noiw but when it fails it doesnt tell you why.

Hopefully once firescope update the web serviceds to offer more functionality i will increase the features. Right now they are very limited. Would really like to see a AED a AD web service in the future.
