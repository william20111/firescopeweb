firescopeweb
============

A simple GUI application for adding CI's into firescope monitoring solution. Very experimental and could be broken as i update the GUI and functions. The web services in Firescope are limited but this will alow the following once finished.

- Add Ci's
- Apply template

Hopefully once firescope update the web serviceds to offer more functionality i will increase the features.
