firescopeweb
============

A simple GUI application for adding CI's into firescope monitoring solution. Very experimental and could be broken as i update the GUI and functions. The web services in Firescope are limited but this application provides the features below:

- Add CI's
- Link CI's to Templates
- Delete CI's
- Create logical groups

Hopefully once firescope update the web serviceds to offer more functionality i will increase the features. Right now they are very limited. Would really like to see a AED a AD web service in the future.
