firescopeweb
============

A simple GUI application for adding CI's into firescope monitoring solution. Very experimental and could be broken as i update the GUI and functions. The web services in Firescope are limited but this currently allows you to:

- Add CI's

Hopefully in next few weeks I shall add in the ability to assign templates. 

Hopefully once firescope update the web serviceds to offer more functionality i will increase the features. Right now they are very limited.
